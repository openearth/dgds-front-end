The Deltares Global Data Services platform has been developed by Deltares as a free, web-based application to support the study and sharing of integrated water and subsoil-related data. The platform provides indicative data, that is primarily intended for professional specialists and researchers.

Users are presented with global water and subsoil-related data through use of our multi-data viewer. The datasets included are subdivided over three different themes, which can be selected on the left side of the screen: Flooding, Coastal Management and Offshore data.  The three themes incorporate datasets for amongst others global shoreline changes, global bathymetry, global river discharge and storm surge forecasts and global metocean conditions. Further information with each dataset is provided through the data selection menu.

The user can change the dataset shown using the selection menu on the right side of the screen. By activating the radial button, spatial maps can be enabled for each dataset. By activating the toggle button, time series can be enabled for each dataset at selected locations. If available at a location, time series for multiple datasets can be shown concurrently. Furthermore, after registration the platform allows users to download selected data to the userâ€™s device.

The information included in the Global Data Services platform is only validated to a limited extent. Neither the platform nor the data provided through the platform are fit for decision making or operational purposes, such as, but not limited to, providing flood forecasts to third parties or the general public.

For questions regarding the platform or the datasets included, please contact [dataservices@deltares.nl](mailto:dataservices@deltares.nl).
