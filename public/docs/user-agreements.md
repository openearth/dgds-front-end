- 2.2 Aqua Monitor Data Products
  - 2.2.1	The purpose of the Aqua Monitor Data Products is to support the analysis of surface water changes. The Aqua Monitor Data Products serve as free data, generated on a global scale with a resolution of 30 metres, that visualize where water has been converted into land and vice-versa. These surface water changes are detected in real-time by using satellite imagery.
  - 2.2.2	The Aqua Monitor Data Products are purely indicative data. User hereby agrees NOT to use the Aqua Monitor Data Products for any decision-making or operational purposes.  
- 2.3 GLOFFIS and GLOSISS Data Products (Water level, Surge height, Tide, Wind, Waves, Discharge, Precipitation and Air temperature):

  - 2.7.1 The CHASM Data Products are provided as a deliverable of a project aimed at innovations in numerical metocean modelling. Care has been taken to incorporate the latest scientific insights and to validate the methods against measured metocean data. However, a more elaborate validation is recommended before using the data for operational and/or planning purposes.
- 2.8 Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) Data Products (Water level indicators and Tidal indicators)
  - 2.8.1 The Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) Data Products are provided to give User a merely indicative first view of governing water level and tidal conditions at a location or area of User’s choice. Hindcast data from the GTSM form the basis for the water level and tidal indicators that are available on our website. It is noted the global data sources used are generally of rather coarse spatial resolution and dedicated local studies may be needed for more detailed output.
  - 2.8.2 The Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) Products may NOT be suitable for use for operational purposes as is.
