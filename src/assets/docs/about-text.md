This is a beta release of the Blue Earth Data platform. The Blue Earth Data platform has been developed by Deltares as a free, web-based application to support the study and sharing of integrated water and subsoil-related data. The platform provides indicative data, which is primarily intended for professional specialists and researchers.

Users are presented with global water and subsoil-related data through use of our multi-data viewer. The datasets included are subdivided over different themes and areas of interest, which can be selected on the left side of the screen. The global data is grouped under the Flooding, Coastal Management and Offshore themes. These themes incorporate datasets for amongst others global shoreline changes, global bathymetry, global river discharge and storm surge forecasts and global metocean conditions. Additionally, some regional datasets are added for the North Sea. Further information with each dataset is provided through the data selection menu.

Datasets can be selected by using the selection menu on the right side of the screen. By activating the radial button, spatial maps can be enabled for each dataset. By activating the toggle button, time series can be enabled for each dataset at selected locations. If available at a location, time series for multiple datasets can be shown simultaneously. Furthermore, after registration the platform allows users to download selected data to the users device.
